For the first milestone, you will need to create the narrative for your adventure game. This will be a story to keep the player entertained. You may choose from any genre. Maybe you are a fan of mysteries or sci-fi. Or maybe you prefer to create a fantasy story or to choose something closer to real life.
Your game runs without error, interacts with the player in meaningful ways, and has some kind of story progression.

These are the things that is needed to be added to the game.
Your game implements a significant number of programming concepts that we've learned in class to show off your mastery of the material. An 'A' game will include:

The game works completely by running the main game file
The main character class includes several attributes that are used in all game sections
Win and lose conditions
If/elif/else statements
Defining and using functions (in addition to the start() functions Iâ€™ve already given you)
For and while loops
Adding to, deleting from, and searching through a list (some kind of inventory or collection)
Checking for valid user input
Generating and incorporating random numbers; picking random elements from a list
Your game includes proper comments in every file. This includes the usual header comments, as well as comments throughout your code describing what it's doing.

Your game is submitted to your Github account.
